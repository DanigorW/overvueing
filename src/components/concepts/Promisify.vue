        Promisification is a long word for a simple transformation. Itâ€™s the conversion of a function that accepts a callback into a function that returns a promise.
        Such transformations are often required in real-life, as many functions and libraries are callback-based. But promises are more convenient, so it makes sense to promisify them.
        It's possible to create a global function in mixins folder exactly like we did above on the debounce section. But because it's one of the must complicated subjects in javascript i'll show it in vaniila.
        If you need a global Promisification function look at the debounce example above, it's the exact thing.
