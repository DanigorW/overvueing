            content="Recursion can be tough to understand especially for new programmers. In simple words, a recursive function is one that calls itself until the condition needed found. Think of matryoshka doll you can have a doll with 10-20 small dolls insite of it.
            Each time you call your function the function opens a new doll until you get the last one.
            The most important part of a recursion is the base case â€” the condition, when met, stops the function from calling itself. Without a base case, a recursive function keeps going in an infinite loop.
