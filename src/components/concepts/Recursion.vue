            content="Recursion can be tough to understand at first, especially for the beginner programmers. In simple words - a recursive function is the function which calls itself up until a `stop condition` is satisfied, and only then returns the result. Think, for example, about a matryoshka doll - you can have a doll with 10-20 small dolls inside of it.
            Each time you call your function the function opens a new doll until you get the last one.
            The most important part of a recursion is the base case â€” the condition, when met, stops the function from calling itself. Without a base case, a recursive function keeps going in an infinite loop.

            codeblock="const countMatryoshka = (n) => {
    if (n === 1)
        return 1;
    else
        return 1 + countMatryoshka(n - 1);
}
// Most common interview question, fibonacci sequence
// In the next section (Memoization) there is an explanation with more advanced example
const fibonacci = (n) => {
    if (n <= 2) {
        return 1
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
